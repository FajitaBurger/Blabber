FILES:
markov.py               - markov chain implementation
tools.py                - extra functions used in many classes
                        (for organization's sake)
sentence_generator.py   - parses through a (text) file and uses markov chain to
                            generate a random sentence
main.py                 -test script using sentence_generator

TODO:
1. Implement the markov.py. You can test your class by running that file. You
   can change the file being tested on. For now, ignore the level parameter. You 
   can change the txt file tested on. 

2. Implement n-th level markov chain for your markov.py. You can test this by
   changing the level parameter.

3. Try to apply your markov chain class with other lists. You can rewrite the
   sentence one or even do on an audio file analysis(HINT: JOURNEY PROJECT)
